# Scrapped-wafers-during-manufacturing


Semiconductors are the brains of today's electronics. They enable technologies critical to a nation's economic growth, national security and global competitiveness. From smartphones to airplanes, semiconductors have evolved to improve technologies and do wonders for your entertainment and convenience. Industries that rely heavily on semiconductors include computing, telecommunications, consumer electronics, banking, security, automotive/transportation, healthcare and manufacturing [1].

To build the devices on a chip, we need the basic substrate, or wafer. A wafer is a thin slice of semiconductor, such as crystalline silicon (c-Si), used to make integrated circuits. While silicon is the basic material, there are wafers that contain other elements.

Semiconductor manufacturers request wafers from suppliers based on order volume and their experiments for process and technology improvement and development. This dataset is a use case from one of India's leading wafer manufacturers. No wafer manufacturer wants to manufacture products with anomalies. There are two data sets, the Train.csv and the Test.csv. The Train.csv contains the characteristics (without indicating the role during production) and the class of Fail or Pass for the wafer. The aim of this project is to find a model that predicts wafers with anomalies.

The dataset has been taken by kaggle:

One of the next days I will write everything including figures as an article!
