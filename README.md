# Scrapped-wafers-during-manufacturing


Semiconductors are the brains of modern electronics. They enable technologies critical to a country's economic growth, national security, and global competitiveness. From smartphones to planes, semiconductors evolved to improve technologies and do wonders for your entertainment and convenience. Industry sectors that rely a lot on semiconductors are Computing, Telecommunications, Household Appliances, Banking, Security, Automotive/Transportation, Healthcare and Manufacturing [1].

To build up the devices of a chip we need the basic substrate, the wafers. A wafer is a thin slice of semiconductor, such as a crystalline silicon (c-Si), used for the fabrication of integrated circuits. While the silicon is the basic material, there are wafers which include other elements.

Semiconductor manufacturers request wafers from suppliers based on the volume of orders and their experiments for process and technology enhancement and development. This dataset is a use-case from one of India's leading manufacturers of wafers. No wafer manufacturer want to create products with anomalies. There are two datasets, the Train.csv and Test.csv. The Train.csv includes features (without indicating the role during the production) and the class of Fail or Pass for the wafer. The role of this project is to find a model that forecasts the wafers with anomalies.

The dataset has been taken by kaggle:

One of the next days I will write everything including figures as an article!
